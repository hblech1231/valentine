              Friday Jan 23rd, 2026 at 11:57 AM "well it's just like you didn't ask me to be your valentine".
              Little did she know that I was spending my time developing this page to do just that. Oh Dina… where do I
              even start?
              Loving you is the easiest thing I have ever done... writing the code for this page, not so much. Its a
              good thing I had
              the pictures of us on my desk to keep me motivated. Now that it is finished, I hope that the effort shows
              even the slightest bit of how much I love you.
              I hope you like it!
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              I made this little page just to say I love you… and I have a question.
